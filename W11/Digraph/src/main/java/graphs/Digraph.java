/*
    HashSet: A HashSet is a Set that is implemented using a hash table. It offers constant-time performance for the basic operations (add, remove, contains, and size), assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the buckets. HashSets are not synchronized, so they are not thread-safe. If multiple threads access a hash set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized externally.

    TreeSet: A TreeSet is a Set that is implemented using a tree data structure. It provides an ordered Set, meaning that the elements in the Set are sorted according to their natural ordering, or according to a Comparator provided at the time the set is created. TreeSets are also not synchronized, so they are not thread-safe. If multiple threads access a tree set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized externally.

    LinkedHashSet: A LinkedHashSet is a Set that is implemented using a hash table with a linked list running through it. It maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries, in the order in which they were added. This allows the LinkedHashSet to maintain an order for its elements, which is useful if you need to maintain the insertion order of the elements. Like HashSet and TreeSet, LinkedHashSet is not synchronized, so it is not thread-safe. If multiple threads access a linked hash set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it should be synchronized externally.
